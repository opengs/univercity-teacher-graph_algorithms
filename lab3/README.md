## Graph Connectivity. Disjoint-set (Union-find Forest) data structure

Create the Disjoint-set datastructure that will be able to determine in time O(1) that two components of the graph are connected.
Load structure with datasets:
10 - 8
3 - 1
8 - 9
1 - 5
5 - 7
2 - 6
6 - 4
6 - 5

Validate if are connected:
1) 10 and 7
2) 10 and 9
3) 3 and 4
Write down the results.

## Topological sorting
Using the topological sorting (DFS implementation) sort the graph below:

1 -> 4
1 -> 5
2 -> 4
3 -> 5
3 -> 8
4 -> 6
4 -> 7
4 -> 8
5 -> 7

## Minimum spanning tree. Prim's algorithm

Write Prims algorithm and apply it to the tree below:

10 - 8
3 - 1
8 - 9
1 - 5
5 - 7
2 - 6
6 - 4
6 - 5
10 - 1
5 - 9
3 - 2
2 - 1

What result do you receive?
