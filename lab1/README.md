# Graphs representations

## Assignments
Use your language of choice to describe graph using different methods

### Linked nodes
Nodes: [1,2,3,4,5]
Edges:
1. 1 -> 3
2. 2 -> 5
3. 3 -> 5
4. 5 -> 3
5. 1 -> 2
Use the linked nodes method. Create `Node` and `Graph` class for it.

### Two-dimensional table

Nodes: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
Edges:
1. 2 -> 4
2. 5 <- 2
3. 3 -> 8
4. 3 -> 6
5. 6 -> 5
6. 5 -> 2
7. 9 -> 1
8. 8 -> 1
